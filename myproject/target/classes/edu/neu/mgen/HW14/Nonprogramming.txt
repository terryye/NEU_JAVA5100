1) How can we add GUI to a Java program?
We can use GUI library such as Swing or JavaFX to create GUIs.
For example, if we choose Swing:
Import the necessary Swing packages, such as javax.swing.*.
Create a JFrame (a window) as the main container.
Add components like JButton, JLabel, and JTextField to the frame.

2) What is AWT - Abstract Windowing Toolkit?
The Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) supports Graphical User Interface
(GUI) programming. AWT features include:
- A set of native user interface components
- A robust event-handling model
- Graphics and imaging tools, including shape, color, and font classes
- Layout managers, for flexible window layouts that do not depend on a particular window size or screen resolution
- Data transfer classes, for cut-and-paste through the native platform clipboard

3) What is Swing?
The Swing classes are built on top of the AWT architecture. It is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) toolkit that includes
the GUI components.
- Swing provides a rich set of widgets and packages to make sophisticated GUI components for Java applications.
- Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes(JFC), which is an API for Java GUI programing that provide GUI.
- The Java Swing library is built on top of the Java Abstract Widget Toolkit (AWT), an older, platform dependent GUI toolkit.
- We can use the Java simple GUI programming components like button, textbox, etc., from the library and do not have to create the components from scratch.
