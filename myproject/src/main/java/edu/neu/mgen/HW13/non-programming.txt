1) What is JDBC?
JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. It is a Java API to connect and execute the query with database.
It is a part of JavaSE, JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with database.

There are four types of JDBC driver:
JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver
Native driver
Network Protocol Driver
Thin driver

2) How to connect your Java program to a database?
We can use the JDBC API to access tabular data stored in a relational database. With JDBC, we can perform operations like saving, updating, deleting, and retrieving data from the database.

JDBC functions similarly to Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) provided by Microsoft.
When a Java application requires a database connection, you can use one of the DriverManager.getConnection() methods to establish a connection.
The URL format for the connection depends on the specific database and JDBC driver. While the URL always starts with the jdbc: protocol, the remainder is determined by the database vendor.
Example URL format for different databases:
MySQL: jdbc:mysql://hostname:port/databaseName
PostgreSQL: jdbc:postgresql://hostname:port/databaseName
